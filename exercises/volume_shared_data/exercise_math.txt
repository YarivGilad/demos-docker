- Create two dockers which have access to a shared folder on the host.
	(use --volume)
	Every x time a docker wakes up and reads the data and writes
	a new line to it (with append) and a value greater by m (a number)
	The other docker wakes up ever y seconds and increases the value by n.
	do f.flush on every write to force changed to the storage level.
- make the two containers be based on the same image.
- on the host, observe the file changes using:
	$ tail -f [filename]
- ecstasy!
