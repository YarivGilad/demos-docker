- Create a docker image with python for ubuntu.
- Add a small application that runs in a loop and writes some data to the data folder.
- Use data volumes to make sure that the application writes to a data volume
	(data volumes are achieved using the --volume command line argument to "docker run")
- Run the docker images as a container for 20 seconds.
- Kill the container.
- check the data volume to see that you have data from 20 seconds of operation.
