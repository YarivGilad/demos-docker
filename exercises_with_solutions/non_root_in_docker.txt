Create a docker image which runs a python app as a non root user.

Prepare, when building the docker image, data for the app.

Show that:
- your app doesn't run as root (os.getuid())
- that your app can read the data.
- that your app can write to the file which is the data.

hints:
WORKDIR
RUN chown
RUN mkdir
USER command in Dockerfile
COPY
